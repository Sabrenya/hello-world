# hello-world


Hey Ya'll!

My names Sabrina and I'm excited to be here.
I would be more excited if I were in the line of totality for todays Solar Eclipse but hey what can ya do

I'm just grateful for the opportunity to live during this day and age. No matter how messy things are right now in the world, life is a miracle and americans are blessed.
